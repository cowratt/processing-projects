<p> This is a test of orbital dynamics that I did in processing.</p>
<p>The ball orbits the mouse (though you have to spin the mouse around to get it to get the ball going </p>
<p>Press spacebar to disable gravitational decay (the ball will orbit forever that way)</p>
<p>click your mouse to "draw" the path of the ball</p>
